# Methodology-for-business-cycle-forecasting-by-the-prism-of-labor-market

Abstract
The market economy has suffered from an inborn "disease" since its beginning. The market economy to this day simply fails to function stably and sustainably. High economic activity and overloading of production possibilities are always replaced by painful crises, bankruptcies and poverty. This phenomenon is known as the business cycle. Countries are constantly trying to develop different methods of forecasting and controlling the waves of the business cycle, but to date without success. For the last 20 years, the world economy has experienced several crises and peaks without the state economic policy being able to both predict and counteract them. This report tries to help in what is the biggest deficit - forecasting the dynamics of economic activity so that economic policy has time to create preconditions and measures of response. Various methods for time series analysis and the power of neural networks and deep learning to forecast the business cycle through the prism of one of the most important indicators - the unemployment rate - will be presented.
